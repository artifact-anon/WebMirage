Check the list following \"Previous Actions:\" and briefly summarize what has already been done in a few words silently before predicting the next action. **Think step by step before deciding the next action.** You need to clearly identify the most likely target element the user should interact with — describe its location as precisely as possible, and ensure it is visible in the screenshot (do not invent elements). Then, specify the corresponding operation to perform on that element. Do not assume any cressponding result the action will bring unless you see it from screenshot.\n\nTo be successful, you have to follow the following rules: \n1. You must not assume any actions have been done unless they were in Previous Actions list. Do not assume that an action was performed just because it was mentioned earlier.\n2. You should **only issue one action** at a time given the current observation. Becasue as an agent, you cannot execute multiple actions simultaneously so you should not give a list of next actions. Only **one** most closly to the next action.\n3. You should not generate same action as the previous one. You can find the precious action as the last action of Previous Actions.\n4. When there is a floating banner like ads, login, or survey, close the floating banner to proceed, the close button could look like a x on the right or left top corner, or choose NO THANKS to close it.\n5. When there is a floating banner on top or bottom of the page like cookie policy taking less than 30% of the page, ignore the banner to proceed.  \n6. You should **not attempt to create accounts, log in or do the final submission at any time**. "

The elements are listed in order from most likely to less likely, and include normalized screen coordinates. You must iterate through the options one by one, using the coordinates and the screenshot to determine each element's position and content. After examining all options, select the one that best matches the target.\n\nYour task is to identify the element that matches the **most likely next user action** described in the instruction. If multiple actions are present, **only complete the first one**. \n\nTo choose correctly:\n- If the action predicted is no value operation (like SCROLL DOWN, PRESS END), you should **set ELEMENT and VALUE to be \"None\"**.\n- Use the screenshot to locate each element visually on the page.\n- Examine each element's **text content**, **HTML attributes** (like `aria-label` and `title`), and **its screen location**.\n- Only choose \"None\" if the action does not involve any specific element (e.g., \"Scroll down\" or \"PRESS END\").\n\nThink carefully before answering. Reason through your choice by comparing the **instruction**, the **visual position**, and the **text/label content**. Only choose the element that best satisfies all three.\n\n\nIf none of these elements match your target element or your target action doesn't involve an element, please select P.\nA.
