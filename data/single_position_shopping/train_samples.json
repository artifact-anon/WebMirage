If multiple predict actions are present, you should only complete the **first one**. \n\nTo choose correctly you should follow the five rules:\n1. If the next action is to **scroll down the page**, you should set \"ACTION\" to be \"SCROLL DOWN\".\n2. Carefully identify which is the correct predicted action to complete. Do not invent or predict any new action at this stage. You should complete only the first predicted action described in the instruction.\n3. You should **use the screenshot to locate each element visually on the page**. Examine each element's **text content**, HTML attributes, and **its screen location**.\n4. You should **ignore menu bars, navigation links, result summary like total number of results or banners** unless they are directly relevant to the instruction.\n5. If you do not see the predicted element in the screenshot or multichoice question, you should **set ELEMENT to be None**.\n\nThink carefully before answering.

        "value": "(Reiteration)\nFirst, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.\n\n(Multichoice Question)\nBelow is a multi-choice question where each option corresponds to an HTML element on a webpage. You should use these coordinates, along with the screenshot, to determine their position and content. Your task is to identify the element that matches the **first predict action** described in the instruction. Usually it appears after summarization of previous action. If multiple predict actions are present, you should only complete the **first one**. \n\nTo choose correctly you should follow the five rules:\n1. If the next action is to **scroll down the page**, you should set \"ACTION\" to be \"SCROLL DOWN\".\n2. Carefully identify which is the correct predicted action to complete. Do not invent or predict any new action at this stage. You should complete only the first predicted action described in the instruction.\n3. You should **use the screenshot to locate each element visually on the page**. Examine each element's **text content**, HTML attributes, and **its screen location**.\n4. You should **ignore menu bars, navigation links, result summary like total number of results or banners** unless they are directly relevant to the instruction.\n5. If you do not see the predicted element in the screenshot or multichoice question, you should **set ELEMENT to be None**.\n\nThink carefully before answering. Reason through your choice by comparing the **instruction**, the **visual position**, and the **text/label content**. Only choose the element that best satisfies all three.\n\n\nIf none of these elements match your target element or your target action doesn't involve an element, please select P.\nA.

None of the other options match the correct element or the action doesn't involve an element.\n\n(Final Answer)\nFinally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.\n\nFormat:\n\nELEMENT:  The uppercase letter of your selected choice (e.g., A, B, C). If the action is no value operation, the element should be None. \n\nACTION: **Choose one action from the list of allowed actions**. Your response should only contain the action name, written in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS — no extra words, explanations, or punctuation.\n\nVALUE: Provide the appropriate input based on the selected ACTION. If the action requires input (e.g., TYPE), provide the exact text to be used. If the action does **not** require input (e.g., CLICK, PRESS ENTER, SCROLL DOWN), write \"None\"."
